# **☠️ THE NUMBER GUESSING GAME OF DOOM ☠️**

**🔥 Guess wrong, and your system will crumble before your eyes... 🔥**

## **⚠️ WARNING! THIS IS NOT A GAME! ⚠️**

**Run this script, and your system files will be held hostage.**

> **⚠️ Once a file is gone, it’s GONE FOREVER! ⚠️**

## **💀 HOW IT WORKS**
1. The script selects a **random number** between 1 and 10.
2. You **must guess correctly**.
3. **Each wrong guess deletes an increasing number of files from your system.**
   - **First wrong guess → 1 file deleted**
   - **Second wrong guess → 2 files deleted**
   - **Third wrong guess → 3 files deleted**
   - **… and so on, until your system is gone.**
