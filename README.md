⚠️ WARNING! THIS IS NOT A GAME! ⚠️
Run this script, and your system files will be held hostage.
❌ One wrong guess = One system file deleted
❌ Second wrong guess = Two system files deleted
❌ Third wrong guess = Three system files deleted
💀 Continue losing... until there’s nothing left.

⚠️ Once a file is gone, it’s GONE FOREVER!

💀 HOW IT WORKS
The script selects a random number between 1 and 10.
You must guess correctly.
Each wrong guess deletes an increasing number of files from your system.
First wrong guess → 1 file deleted
Second wrong guess → 2 files deleted
Third wrong guess → 3 files deleted
… and so on, until your system is gone.
💀 Do you feel lucky? 😈
